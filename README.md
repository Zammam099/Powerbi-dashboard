 Dashboard Creation using PowerBi: 

 Objective -  To contribute to the success of a business by utilizing data analysis techniques, specially focusing on time series analysis , to provide valuable insights and accurate sales forecasting.


I identified key performance indicators (KPIs) and meticulously designed an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard. 
This dashboard includes interactive visualizations and advanced filtering capabilities, empowering users to explore data at various levels of granularity effortlessly.

I have made 13 different KPIs for the global super store which can clearly be seen in the presented PowerBi dashboard.

The KPIs are as follows:


1.	Orders: It shows the total number of orders placed in 2  years.

2.	Sales: It shows the total amount of sales done by the super store.

3.	Profit : It shows the total profit made by selling different categories of products.

4.	Ship days: It is basically showing the average shipping days that the global super store takes to deliver the products to the customers.
(Used a DAX function (datediff()) to calculate the difference between the order date and the delivery date).

5.	Sales by Payment Mode: It shows the overall composition of different payment methods used by the customers.

6.	Sales by region: It shows the how the total sales is distributed among the different regions of the country.
7.	Sales by Category : This KPI is depicting the sales in category-wise.

8.	Sales by Sub - Category : This KPI is depicting the sales done in sub-category-wise.

9.	Sales by Ship Mode: It basically shows the composition of different ship modes preferred by the customers for their delivery.

10.	Sales by Month : This KPI is a comparison done over a line chart comparing the profits booked over different months.

11.	Sales by Segment : This KPI is a comparison done over a line chart comparing the profits booked over different months.

12.	Slicer ‚Äì There is a slicer which is data field as a region which is one of the most powerful tool of powerBi.
